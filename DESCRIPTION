Description: annotator3D classifies genomic annotations into 
    topologically-associateing domains (TADs).
    The TADs may or may not be identified with agglomerative clustering. 
    In the provided example, 
    hierarchical clustering is employed to calculate the probability 
    of TAD and sub-TAD membership.
